Salman's Coding Playground
- `quick_test.py` is for rapid prototyping/testing of a library/algorithm. Code developed her should be moved to individual scripts upon prototype completion.
- `data` directory is for storing important reference images. But images generated during testing etc. shouldn't be checked in.
